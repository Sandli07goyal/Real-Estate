## Steps to Run the Application

Pull the repository into your device and run it as you used to run Django Application.

$ git clone https://github.com/dhruvsethi708/Real-Estate.git


You need to install 'requirements.txt' in your python virtual environment.

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

You also need to build React Application as it has been ignored in git and also need node_modules.
